<h1>What make this stand out?</h1>
<p>I have done numerous researches and I have seen that there are still a number of missing items in the available CGPA Calculators. Among these are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Not going up the stream to more User Experience Interface</li>
    <li>Less time spent in understanding how the use of this app is relatable to subconcious activities and achievemnts of the users</li>
    <li>Often simply seen as just a side project and not a major concern for the user</li>
</ul>

<h1>What are you Proposing?</h1>
<p>What I am proposing is a standard CGPA Calculator that will be made available to student as a service. It is high time only a few tirelessly stress throught to what can be reprogrammed thoughtfully into a Design system for use, for even a larger population, the Nigeria Students, and Diaspora.</p>
